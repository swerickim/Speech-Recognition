# Project Overview
This can be used for automatically transcribing and summarizing lecture recordings, podcasts, or videos. 

I also included a way to hook up a microphone to automatically record and transcribe audio for live notetaking. This could be used to record and transcribe meetings in real-time. 

#### Project Steps

1. Create a speech recognition system using vosk
2. Add punctuation to the text transcript using recasepunc
3. Summarize the text using a huggingface summarization pipeline
4. Create a widget to record and transcribe live audio
